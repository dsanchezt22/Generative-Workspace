# Trus — Project Status

_An AI-orchestrated personal operating system: describe what you want to organize, and the system generates the exact tool for it._

**Last updated:** 2026-07-05
**Repo:** https://github.com/dsanchezt22/Generative-Workspace
**Branch state:** Stage 1 + 2a + 2b are merged into `main` (merge commit `24f22e3`). Stage 3 (`stage3/differentiators`) branches off that merged main, now complete at `89f70d6`; final whole-branch review and merge decision remain open.

---

## Architecture (the one decision everything rests on)

The AI **never generates UI code**. The orchestrator turns a prompt into a typed
`ModuleConfig` (JSON: which components, how they bind, what's prefilled), and the
frontend renders that config with a fixed, trusted component library. This keeps
output instant, consistent, and impossible to break into "malformed HTML."

```
prompt ──▶ Gemini (orchestrator) ──▶ ModuleConfig (JSON) ──▶ trusted components ──▶ canvas
```

- **Backend:** Python 3.12 (Docker) · FastAPI · SQLite (stdlib) · `google-genai`
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind v4

## Stage 1 — structural blockers (shipped)

Closed the 7 cross-cutting findings from `docs/MVP-GAP-AUDIT.md` that stood between a local demo and a hostable 50-user alpha:

1. **One shared trust domain** → invite-claim identity (`users` table, session `uid`), per-owner scoping of the generation cache and layout library.
2. **Event loop blocked on every model call** → LLM/vision calls moved off the async event loop; one generation no longer freezes health checks and saves for every user.
3. **Silent degradation everywhere** → honest refusal on unreadable input, degraded/cascade output never cached or persisted as a fake success.
4. **No schema versioning for persisted configs** → tolerant reads; one corrupt row quarantines itself instead of 500ing the whole workspace.
5. **Zero observability** → structured logging, per-generation telemetry (`gen_events`), operator summary endpoint.
6. **Data-loss races in the client** → single-writer module saves, rev-based optimistic-concurrency conflict detection across tabs.
7. **Quality gates red at HEAD** → green baseline restored, coverage gate reconciled and raised, frontend test/CI job added.

## Stage 2a — reliability completions (shipped)

Landed the two security decisions from the Stage 1 final review plus the triaged backlog:

- **Security decision A:** Origin gate on state-changing multipart endpoints (upload/import/capture) — closes the `SameSite=None` cross-site CSRF vector.
- **Security decision B:** SSRF guard on studio `image_url` — refuses private/loopback/link-local/metadata targets and redirect bypasses; URL import off by default in prod.
- **R-1102:** destructive actions confirmed or undoable — page delete shows a typed module-count confirm, module removal is archive-first (restorable), permanent delete is confirmed; snapshot restore is now one atomic transaction that preserves module ids (cross-module bindings survive a restore).
- **R-211:** documents ground on every provider, not just Gemini's native multimodal path — server-side text extraction (`pypdf` + plain-text decode) feeds the normal generation path ahead of the honest-refusal fallback.
- **R-1201/R-1202:** telemetry completions — file-upload generations carry real provenance (provider/model), ops summary reports per-user last-seen, `/api/llm/status` is trimmed in prod.
- **R-602/R-1101 backlog:** saver hardening — 404 responses are treated as "forgotten" (no retry loop), `beforeunload` does a best-effort keepalive flush of pending edits, module commits use functional updates (no same-tick stale-closure class), the degraded-generation notice moved off the error-red channel.
- Small-backlog batch: studio layout rows quarantine on parse failure instead of breaking the list; `requirements.txt` (runtime) split from `requirements-dev.txt` (test tooling) so the Docker image doesn't bundle pytest.

## Stage 2b — input surfaces (shipped)

Ships the brief's must-have input story — entry-as-interview, voice rambling, sketch-to-module, and the prescriptive idea-generation package:

- **R-101/R-104/R-105 — entry-as-interview front door:** `IntroSplash`'s decorative overlay replaced with a true pre-workspace entry (rotating "Tell me what's on your mind" headline, a large mic affordance as the primary control, a text field as the visible secondary), shown on a first-visit-empty-workspace session or via EmptyState re-entry; dissolves to canvas on submit, Escape/Skip dismisses, keyboard-reachable (`role="dialog"`, focus starts on the text field).
- **R-201-204 — voice rambling:** new pluggable `POST /api/transcribe` (`TRUS_STT_*` env, OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions`; unset → honest 422) + a PromptBar mic rework — press-to-start/stop recording, transcript appends into the input (never overwrites), Web Speech interim text as live garnish only, mic-denial degrades to typing without breaking the flow.
- **R-221-223 — sketch overlay → snap:** canvas toolbar Sketch toggle (world-coordinate stroke overlay: pen/eraser/clear), "Snap to modules" rasterizes the sketch and routes it through the existing file-upload vision path with a sketch-tuned hint; overlay clears on success or cancel (ephemeral, R-223).
- **R-102/R-103/R-301 — proposal plans + multi-turn interview:** proposals now carry a one-paragraph `plan` (rendered above the preview stack); the clarifying-question exchange moved server-side (`GenerateRequest.exchange`, hard-capped at 4 answered questions) — fixes the earlier answer-drop bug where PromptBar string-concatenated only the latest answer, and interview-specialized results no longer seed the shared prompt cache.
- **R-302 — conversation context:** the owner's last ~10 messages on the current page feed generation context (not the grounded-file path, and never when there's no page scope); the semantic-cache key stays the raw prompt, so an identical re-prompt still hits.
- **R-104 — per-owner suggestions:** `GET /api/suggestions` — usage-seeded chips drawn from this owner's `gen_cache`/`messages`, R-903-scoped (cross-owner isolation is test-pinned, and reconfirmed in this task's own smoke run below).
- Stage-2a triaged backlog closed alongside: CORS origin-parsing single-sourced into `routes/deps.py`, one `_gemini_model()` helper replacing three copies, `nosemgrep` comments scoped to rule ids, SSRF guard now also checks `is_global` (CGNAT) and refuses redirects, a route-level prod test for `/api/llm/status`.

New env: `TRUS_STT_BASE_URL` / `TRUS_STT_MODEL` / `TRUS_STT_API_KEY` (all optional — absent means voice transcription is an honest 422, never a silent failure). Documented in `.env.example`, the conftest isolation list, and `deploy/README.md`'s env table.

## Stage 3 — differentiators (shipped)

Ships the three things that make Trus more than a reliable generator — last-mile actionability, a memory that evolves, and a spatial "digital clay" feel — plus the carried Stage-2b backlog:

- **Stage-2b backlog burn-down:** composed-prompt token cap (`_MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` ≈12000, lowest-priority blocks — conversation, then module-context — truncated first; the raw user prompt and exchange answers are never touched); transcribe rate limiting (a reusable `_RateLimiter`, ≤20 calls/5min per owner, 429 on the 21st — now also the live-data route's limiter); server-side suggestion noise filter (📎/refine-join/short-fragment junk is stripped in `db.py` before it ever leaves the API, not just the frontend); sketch raster dimension clamp (the offscreen export canvas is capped at ~2048px/side via a downscale factor); an entry-screen focus trap (mirrors `ConfirmDialog`); and a `preview` flag on `generate_from_file` wired into the file-attach caller so a file upload goes through the same preview→confirm stack as a text prompt (the sketch-snap caller stays direct-insert — a documented scope call: unifying it would require lifting `PromptBar`'s preview state into a shared parent, judged too large for this task).
- **R-701/R-702/R-704/R-705 — live external data:** a new `data_source` field (`{provider, query, refresh_secs, label}`) on Metric, Kpi, Ring, Gauge, and ProgressBar. `GET /api/live/{provider}` (owner-gated, rate-limited) is backed by `services/live_data.py` — keyless Open-Meteo for weather (geocodes a place name, or takes lat/lon directly) and Open Food Facts for nutrition (kcal/100g) — both SQLite-cached with a `refresh_secs` TTL; a provider failure returns the last-cached value marked `stale`, or an honest null value with the error surfaced — nothing is ever fabricated. The orchestrator's decompose prompt now emits `data_source` bindings for the two launched domains (calorie/food → nutrition, weather/trip/hike → weather) and strips any out-of-domain or malformed binding on both the decompose *and* refine parse paths, so the component survives as plain manual entry rather than the whole module failing validation — an unlaunched domain (stocks, flights) never gets a fake live badge (R-705). The frontend's `useLiveValue` hook polls on mount and every `refresh_secs`, renders an "as of … · via Open-Meteo/Open Food Facts" freshness line, degrades to a muted stale badge on provider failure while the control stays manually editable (R-703, verified concretely on Ring/Gauge's bound input), and falls back to the plain manual field when `TRUS_LIVE_DATA=off`.
- **R-801/R-802/R-803/R-804/R-1003 — evolving user profile:** a new owner-scoped `user_profile` store (`kind` ∈ goal/preference/pattern/fact, `source` ∈ interview/manual, capped at 50 facts/owner with oldest-pruned, deduped per owner+kind) behind `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/profile` and a clear-all `DELETE /api/profile`. Accretion fires on a **confirmed** module insert that carries the interview exchange (`POST /api/modules`) — moved there from generate/preview after review, so nothing accretes from a proposal the user never accepted — storing the user's own stated answers verbatim, tagged goal/fact by a `want`/`goal`/`track` keyword heuristic. A bounded "What I know about you:" block (~800 chars, most-recent facts first) feeds `generate_modules`'s composed system message — confirmed to never affect the semantic-cache key (an identical prompt still cache-hits with a fresh profile present) and never reached on the grounded-file path. `ProfilePanel` (new, opened from the sidebar) lists facts grouped by kind, each inline-editable and deletable, with a confirmed "clear all"; `DELETE /api/profile` is a real hard SQL delete — the erasure surface for now (a full-account cascade across every owner-scoped table doesn't exist yet and is a Stage-4 item, documented inline in the route).
- **R-502/R-503/R-504 — visible spatial nesting:** child pages render as world-coordinate, draggable, enterable **portal tiles** on the parent's canvas (the same transform modules and the sketch overlay use) — a restrained dashed-panel affordance showing a live "N tools" count (`GET /api/pages/counts`, no child module configs loaded) and keyboard-reachable via `role="button"` + Enter/Space. Placement (`portal_x`/`portal_y`, an additive migration, owner-scoped) persists server-side across devices via `PATCH /api/pages/{id}`. Fixed a real orphaning bug along the way: `pages.parent_id` has no FK cascade, so `db.delete_page` now reparents a deleted page's children to its own parent (the grandparent, or root if top-level) before deleting — a parent delete never silently drops children from the tree, and a fix-round follow-up moved auto-placed portals onto a shelf above the module grid so they're never rendered underneath (and unclickable behind) a module card.

New env: `TRUS_LIVE_DATA` (default `on`; `off` disables live fetches and every `data_source`-capable component falls back to plain manual entry) — documented in `.env.example` and the conftest isolation list.

## Current gates (this run, 2026-07-05, HEAD `89f70d6`)

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `python -m pytest -q` (repo root, coverage gate on) — run 3× | **567 passed, 2 skipped**, 94.80% coverage (gate: 80%) — identical on all three runs; the previously-de-flaked migration race test (`test_concurrent_migration_on_stale_db_does_not_double_alter`) held stable across all three |
| `mypy backend/src` | clean, 32 source files |
| `ruff check backend/src` | all checks passed |
| `ruff format --check backend/src` | 32 files already formatted |
| `cd frontend && npm test` | 7 test files, **85 passed** |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | clean |
| `npm run build` | clean production build (4 static routes) |

API-level smoke against a fresh backend on a spare port (8120, isolated `TRUS_DB_PATH` in a temp dir — the user's `:8000`/`:3000` and live `trus.db` were never touched): invite-claim flow for two users (Alice/Bob via `python -m src.invites create`) both claim 200 and `/api/auth/me` confirms each; `GET /api/live/weather?place=London` — a real Open-Meteo fetch, 27.8°C; `GET /api/live/nutrition?food=banana` — a real Open Food Facts fetch (the first call hit a transient 503 from OFF's side, honestly surfaced as a null value + `error` field rather than fabricated, exactly the honesty-seam contract; a retry succeeded at 88.1 kcal/100g, and a second food — apple, 63.0 kcal/100g — confirmed a fresh cache key); `GET /api/live/weather` with no params → 422; profile CRUD round-trip (POST → GET shows it → PATCH → DELETE → GET confirms gone) plus cross-owner isolation (Bob's `GET /api/profile` never sees Alice's fact; Bob's `PATCH` on Alice's page also 404s); a 3-level page tree (GrandParent → Mid → Leaf) with the Leaf's `portal_x`/`portal_y` persisted via `PATCH /api/pages/{id}` and read back; deleting Mid (the middle page) reparents Leaf to GrandParent — present, not gone, portal position intact. All passed; transcript in `.superpowers/sdd/stage3-task-10-report.md`.
